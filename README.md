This Assignment assesses the following Learning Outcomes:

 

      I.        Have a deep and systematic understanding of the fundamental concepts underlying procedural programming.

     II.        Have a deep and systematic understanding of the fundamental concepts and facilities offered by a modern object-oriented programming language.

   III.        Be able to write procedural programs as solutions to complex and clearly specified problems.

 

Project Title: Interactive Kotlin Command-Line Utility

 

Objective: Develop a Kotlin-based command-line application that processes user inputs to perform specific calculations and conversions. The application will help students apply procedural programming concepts and implement control flow, data handling, and user input validation using Kotlin.

 

Requirements:

 

Command Handling:
Implement a single function to interpret and execute commands interactively.
Commands to implement (for processing every command a separate function should be implemented):
sum: Calculates (13+ 23 + 33 +...+ n3), where n is a natural number.
conversion: Converts a given temperature from one unit to Celsius, Kelvin, or Fahrenheit.
factorial: Calculates the sum of the factorials of three given integers n1,  n2 and n3.
Input Validation:
Validate user inputs to ensure they are appropriate for the requested calculations.
Provide meaningful error messages if inputs are invalid or out of the expected range.
User Interaction:
The application must interactively request and retrieve input from the console.
Display results or error messages back to the user in a clear and understandable format.
Documentation and Reporting:
Document the project design and implementation in a detailed report.
Include roles and contributions of each team member in implementation and documentation.
Provide the complete Kotlin code and explain the logic and functionality.
Create a flowchart diagram to visually represent the algorithm.
Include screenshots of the code within the IntelliJ IDEA environment to demonstrate the development and testing stages.
 

 

The project will be completed in small teams. Team members have already been assigned, and you can find your team and teammates in the People > Groups section of Canvas. Each team should hold a meeting to discuss and divide the tasks evenly among members.

 

The report should be approximately 5 pages or 1500 words (font size 11, Arial) to be structured to address specific aspects of the assignment. In your group report, please include the names of your team members with their student IDs. 

 

Submission Requirements:

The assignment must be submitted online via StudyNet. Submit your report as a .pdf file.

 

Type of Feedback to be given for this assignment:

Formative verbal feedback can be given during the drop-in sessions as per the module delivery plan. The assignment will be marked according to the above marking scheme. You should address each of the marking components within your assignment.

You can ask your questions related to the assessment activities in the discussion section in StudyNet. These questions and the answers will help you and other students to reflect on the activities you will be undertaking as part of the assessed work for the module. Self-assess your work as you progress through the module which will help you understand the subject better. Feedback is not just the marks and the commentary at the end of the assessment – it is also the regular advice about your work as you undertake the practical activities for the rest of assignments. If you fail to undertake the practical activities and you fail to engage with the class and with the instructors, you will disadvantage yourself.

Additional information:

·         The students’ reports are checked with Turnitin software for plagiarism purposes.

·         In this assessment the student is expressly prohibited from (i) using GenAI tools for the creation of content and (ii) from using GenAI tools or a proofreader or a proofreading service for proofreading. 

·         Regulations governing assessment offences including Plagiarism and Collusion are available from https://www.herts.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/237625/AS14-Apx3-Academic-Misconduct.pdfLinks to an external site. (UPR AS14).

·         For postgraduate modules:

o    a score of 50% or above represents a pass performance at honors’ level. 

o    late submission of any item of coursework for each day or part thereof (or for hard copy submission only, working day or part thereof) for up to five days after the published deadline, coursework relating to modules at Level 7 submitted late (including deferred coursework, but with the exception of referred coursework), will have the numeric grade reduced by 10 grade points until or unless the numeric grade reaches or is 50. Where the numeric grade awarded for the assessment is less than 50, no lateness penalty will be applied.
