## Project: Interactive Kotlin Command-Line Utility

### Objective

Develop a Kotlin-based command-line application that processes user inputs to perform specific calculations and conversions. The application will help students apply procedural programming concepts and implement control flow, data handling, and user input validation using Kotlin.

### Requirements

#### 1. Command Handling

Implement a single function to interpret and execute commands interactively. A **separate function** should be implemented for each command:

- **`sum`** — Calculates `1³ + 2³ + 3³ + ... + n³`, where `n` is a natural number.
- **`conversion`** — Converts a given temperature from one unit to Celsius, Kelvin, or Fahrenheit.
- **`factorial`** — Calculates the sum of the factorials of three given integers `n1`, `n2`, and `n3`.

#### 2. Input Validation

- Validate user inputs to ensure they are appropriate for the requested calculations.
- Provide meaningful error messages if inputs are invalid or out of the expected range.

#### 3. User Interaction

- The application must interactively request and retrieve input from the console.
- Display results or error messages back to the user in a clear and understandable format.

#### 4. Documentation and Reporting

- Document the project design and implementation in a detailed report.
- Include roles and contributions of each team member in implementation and documentation.
- Provide the complete Kotlin code and explain the logic and functionality.
- Create a flowchart diagram to visually represent the algorithm.
- Include screenshots of the code within the IntelliJ IDEA environment to demonstrate development and testing stages.

### Team Collaboration

The project will be completed in small teams. Team members have already been assigned — check **People > Groups** on Canvas. Each team should hold a meeting to discuss and divide tasks evenly.

| **Documentation** | Comprehensive and clear documentation and diagrams (20) | Well-documented but lacks detail in some areas (15) | Adequate; some areas poorly explained (10) | Insufficient; many areas not covered (5) | **20** |
| **Team Contribution** | Detailed and clear explanation of team roles (10) | Good description with minor omissions (7.5) | Some description but lacking clarity (5) | Roles not clearly defined or missing (2.5) | **10** |
| **Presentation** | Exceptionally well-presented (10) | Well-presented with minor format errors (7.5) | Acceptable but lacks polish (5) | Poor presentation, difficult to follow (2.5) | **10** |

**Total: 100 points**
